      "Katy Eby completed 8 more car accessories than Jhonny Larin in the first round, meaning they completed 20 + 8 = 28 car accessories. Jhonny Larin completed 8 fewer car accessories than Katy Eby in the second round, meaning they completed 20 - 8 = 12 car accessories. Jhonny Larin completed -2 more car accessories than Katy Eby in the third round, meaning they completed 20 - 2 = 18 car accessories. Jhonny Larin completed half the number of car accessories as Katy Eby in the last round, meaning they completed 20 / 2 = 10 car accessories. In total, Jhonny Larin completed 28 + 12 + 18 + 10 = 68 car accessories. The average number of car accessories per round completed by Jhonny Larin is 68 / 4 = 17.0 car accessories. \n",

    "To save to `GGUF` / `llama.cpp`, we support it natively now! We clone `llama.cpp` and we default save it to `q8_0`. We allow all methods like `q4_k_m`. Use `save_pretrained_gguf` for local saving and `push_to_hub_gguf` for uploading to HF.\n",

    "Some supported quant methods (full list on our [Wiki page](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/wiki#gguf-quantization-options)):\n",
    "* `q8_0` - Fast conversion. High resource use, but generally acceptable.\n",
